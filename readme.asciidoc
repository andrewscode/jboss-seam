Seam 2: Next generation enterprise Java development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Seam 2.3 targets Java EE 6 capabilities such as JSF2 and JPA2 on the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 (JBoss AS 7) - Seam 2.3 also supports RichFaces 4 which is also available for commercial support via Web Framework Kit. If you are looking for the long-term support with a service level agreement of Seam 2.2 and/or Seam 2.3 then please contact us at http://www.redhat.com/contact/sales.html - Seam 2.3 is part of Web Framework Kit, included as part of the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform subscription.

Seam 2.3 was released in September 2012. This is an update to the Seam 2 code base to make it compatible with Jave EE 6.

Seam 2 is a powerful open source development platform for building rich Internet applications in Java. Seam integrates technologies such as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), JavaServer Faces (JSF), Java Persistence (JPA), Enterprise Java Beans (EJB 3.1) and Business Process Management (BPM) into a unified full-stack solution, complete with sophisticated tooling.

Seam has been designed from the ground up to eliminate complexity at both architecture and API levels. It enables developers to assemble complex web applications using simple annotated Java classes, a rich set of UI components, and very little XML. Seam's unique support for conversations and declarative state management can introduce a more sophisticated user experience while at the same time eliminating common bugs found in traditional web applications.
